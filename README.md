# C-codes-for-ternary-CH-fluids-by-using-a-variant-of-SAV-algorithm
Ternary incompressible CHNS fluid systems are solved by an efficient variant of SAV method with energy relaxation. 
The code is based on C. 
In Sec 4_4, the ternary spinodal decomposition without fluid flow is simulated.
In Sec 4_8, the effect of surface tension coefficients on the defromations of two adjacent droplets in shear flow are simulated.
